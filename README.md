There are three pages. Home page shows the photos of album id:1, there is a link to go to add new user form. After adding new user it will redirect to a new page to tell you it's created and there is a link to go back to the home page. Currently you can enter whatever you want in the form. Because it is fake data the users wouldn't be updated but the server will return the data posted by the form.
